# Bobby Bot 2 - The Continuation

Bobby Bot is a Discord bot that serves as a tinkering space for random ideas I have. Version 1 got very bloated and hard to maintain, so I decided to start over after trying and failing to set it back up. Version 2 will likely end up the same way, but not for a while.

Features:
- Member welcoming (optional)
- Mod Logs (events such as bans, joins, and leaves) (optional)
- Language filter (optional part of Mod Logs, deletes really bad language) (optional)
- Tracks my twitch and yt stats :)

Commands:
- /config configures the welcome message and moderation settings
- /avatar applies a filter to someone's profile picture
- !crop crops the last posted image
